## üöÄ Deployment
* [**New version :**](https://to-do-list-typescript-react.netlify.app/)</br>
Features requiring communication with the database and user management have been implemented using <b>Netlify</b> ‚Äì a platform offering serverless functions and authentication support. With <b>Netlify GoTrue</b>, the application allows users to manage their accounts, including registration, login, password reset and change, as well as account deletion. Additionally, the application enables storing task lists in the <b>MongoDB</b> database, which allows for later retrieval, editing, and saving.
The application supports translating the entire site into three languages: <b>Polish (pl)</b>, <b>English (en)</b>, and <b>German (de)</b>, using <b>react-i18next</b>. New features have also been implemented, such as dynamic translation of error messages using <b>Cloud Translation API</b>, which ensures that server messages are translated in real-time based on the user‚Äôs selected language.
Another novelty is the migration to <b>TanStack Query</b> (formerly <b>React Query</b>) for handling queries and mutations in the app, which significantly simplifies state management and asynchronous operations. The entire application has also been adapted to work with <b>TypeScript</b>, improving code stability and easing maintenance.<br/>https://to-do-list-typescript-react.netlify.app

## üìù Description
<b>To-Do List</b> is an application built with React and TypeScript. This version has been significantly expanded ‚Äì in addition to the classic to-do list features, a number of new improvements and capabilities have been introduced:
* <b>Core Features:</b>
   * Fetch sample tasks <i>(when the list is empty)</i>,
   * Add new tasks,
   * Mark tasks as completed,
   * Search tasks with the ability to show/hide filters and clear them,
   * Display task details,
   * Delete tasks,
   * Hide completed tasks,
   * Mark all tasks as completed and now also unmark all tasks.
* <b>New features:</b>
   * <b>TypeScript support:</b> The app has been rewritten in TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.
   * <b>TanStack Query:</b> Replaced manual fetching (Redux Saga) with useQuery hooks to fetch sample tasks and lists, and useMutation hooks for list mutations and user-related operations.
   * <b>react-i18next:</b> App translation into pl, en, de.
   * <b>Dynamic error translation:</b> Server error messages are translated on the fly using the Cloud Translation API.
   * <b>Streamlined state management:</b> Redux and Saga remain only for global app state; fetching and mutation logic moved to TanStack Query.
   * <b>User Account Management:</b>
      <i>(Implementation based on the [Netlify GoTrue](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js) library with custom UI components.)</i>
      * Registration,
      * Login,
      * Password reset and change,
      * Account deletion.<br>
   * <b>Adding tasks by voice:</b> Ability to enter task content using speech recognition (Web Speech API).

* <b>Lists Page:</b></br>
After logging in, users can access the ‚ÄúLists‚Äù page, where all saved lists from the MongoDB database are displayed. On this page, you can:
   * Preview the contents of a selected list,
   * Load the selected list into current to-do list,
   * Sort the list,
   * Delete the list.
* <b>Saving a list to the database:</b></br>
After logging in, users can save the current to-do list to the database.
* <b>Task Editing:</b></br>
Tasks can be edited (using the pencil icon) with options to undo and redo changes.

The application offers a user-friendly interface that supports effective task management.

## üé§ Adding Tasks by Voice
The application allows you to add and edit tasks using speech recognition. This feature uses the Web Speech API and is available in the add/edit task form.

</br>

**How does it work?**
- Next to the text field, there is a button with a microphone icon.
- Click the microphone to start listening ‚Äì you can dictate the task content.
- The recognized text appears automatically in the text field.
- Clicking the microphone again stops listening.
- If your browser does not support speech recognition, the microphone button will be inactive.

</br>

**Additional information:**
- Various languages are supported ‚Äì the app automatically adjusts the recognition language to the selected interface language.
- In task edit mode, speech recognition continues the existing content.
- Interim results are supported, so the text appears live as you speak (if the browser allows it).

</br>

## üì¨ Contact Form
The application includes a contact form that allows users to send messages directly to the author. This form is integrated using [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/examples/reactjs/), enabling email sending without the need for a backend server.
