## üìù Description
<b>To-Do List</b> is a React-based application now enhanced with TypeScript for improved type safety and maintainability. In addition to the classic to-do list features, this version includes several new functionalities:
* <b>Core Features:</b>
   * Fetch sample tasks <i>(when the list is empty)</i>,
   * Add new tasks,
   * Mark tasks as completed,
   * Search tasks with options to show/hide and clear filters,
   * View task details,
   * Delete tasks,
   * Hide completed tasks,
   * Mark all tasks as completed and now also unmark all tasks.
* <b>New Functionalities:</b>
   * <b>TypeScript Integration: </b> The application now uses TypeScript for better type checking and easier maintenance.
   * <b>User Account Management:</b>
      * Registration,
      * Login,
      * Password reset and change,
      * Account deletion.<br>
      
      <i>(While Netlify Identity offers a built-in login widget, custom components built on [netlify gotrue.js](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js) are used.)</i>
* <b>Lists Page:</b></br>
After logging in, users can access a "Lists" page that displays all saved lists retrieved from a MongoDB database. From this page, you can:
   * View the contents of a selected list,
   * Load the selected list into your current tasks,
   * Delete the list.
* <b>Saving Tasks:</b></br>
Once logged in, you can also save the current to-do list to the database.
* <b>Task Editing:</b></br>
Tasks can be edited (using the pencil icon) with options to undo and redo changes.

The application offers a user-friendly interface that supports effective task management.
